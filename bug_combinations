1. SP square spacing isn't happening, maybe check ATTENTION 1
    pallet_x = 10
    pallet_y = 9
    box_x = 4
    box_y = 3
CHECKED: works as it should, because the first boxes remaining on their original places

2. SP Left - Outwards combination Back side wrong in the square
    pallet_x = 8
    pallet_y = 6
    box_x = 2
    box_y = 3
    label_side = "Left"
    label_place = "Outwards"
